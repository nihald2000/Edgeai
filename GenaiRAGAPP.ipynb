However, Windows’ built-in tools limit FAT32 formatting to drives of 32GB or less, and corporate environments may impose additional restrictions on USB access. In this article, we’ll cover how to format a 64GB USB drive to FAT32 on both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu), troubleshoot detection issues, and discuss workarounds when USB storage is blocked by IT policies.Understanding the FAT32 LimitationFAT32 is widely supported and useful when you need maximum compatibility. However, Windows’ native tools (such as Disk Management or DiskPart) won’t let you format drives larger than 32GB to FAT32 — even though the FAT32 file system itself supports much larger volumes (up to 2TB). This limitation means you must use alternative methods if you have a 64GB drive.Formatting on WindowsMethod 1: Using Third-Party Tools (Recommended)Third-party utilities bypass Windows’ 32GB restriction and offer a quick solution:Rufus:Download Rufus from rufus.ie.Insert your USB drive.Open Rufus and select your USB under the “Device” field.Under “File System,” choose FAT32.Click Start and confirm the formatting process.FAT32 Format Tool:Download the utility from ridgecrop.co.uk.Run the executable, select your USB drive, and click Start.These tools are particularly useful for drives larger than 32GB because they circumvent Windows’ limitations.Method 2: Using PowerShellIf you prefer not to install extra software, you can use PowerShell. Note that formatting a large drive this way may be considerably slower:Open PowerShell as Administrator.Execute the following command (replacing X: with your USB drive letter):format /FS:FAT32 X:Be prepared — this method can take over an hour on a 64GB drive due to the intensive nature of the formatting process.Formatting on Linux (Ubuntu)Linux offers robust command-line tools that make formatting large drives quick and straightforward. Here’s how you can do it via a remote session (for example, through MobaXterm):Step 1: Verify USB DetectionCheck with lsusb:lsusbCheck with lsblk: Next, run:lsblkStep 2: Format the USB Drive to FAT32If the drive is detected (as in the example above), you can proceed:Unmount the Partition (if mounted): Since your output indicates that /dev/sdb1 is not mounted, you can skip this step. If it were mounted, you would use:sudo umount /dev/sdb1Run the Formatting Command:sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdb1Verify the Format:lsblk -fMount the USB (Optional)sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usbsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usbAlternatively, you can use a graphical tool like GParted if you prefer a GUI:sudo apt install gparted -yRun it with:sudo gpartedDealing with Corporate USB RestrictionsIn some corporate environments, USB mass storage may be disabled by IT policiesAsk IT for Temporary Access: If USB access is essential, consider requesting temporary permission or an exception from your IT department.ConclusionFormatting a 64GB USB drive to FAT32 can be straightforward — especially on Linux, where commands like mkfs.fat make the process quick and efficient. On Windows, third-party tools such as Rufus or FAT32 Format are your best bet to overcome the native 32GB limit.
